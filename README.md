A Busser runner plugin for [Bats][bats_site]

## Status

This software project is no longer under active development as it has no active maintainers. The software may continue to work for some or all use cases, but issues filed in GitHub will most likely not be triaged. If a new maintainer is interested in working on this project please come chat with us in #test-kitchen on Chef Community Slack.

## Installation and Setup

Until proper reference documentation is complete, the [Writing a Test](http://kitchen.ci/docs/getting-started/writing-test) section of the Test Kitchen's [Getting Started Guide](http://kitchen.ci/docs/getting-started/) gives a working example of creating a bats test.

## Usage

**TODO:** Write documentation explaining the structure/format of testing files.

## Development

* Source hosted at [GitHub][repo]
* Report issues/questions/feature requests on [GitHub Issues][issues]

example:

1. Fork the repo
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Added some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create new Pull Request
