Feature: Test command
  In order to run tests written with bats
  As a user of Busser
  I want my tests to run when the bats runner plugin is installed

  Background:
    Given a test BUSSER_ROOT directory named "busser-bats-test"
    When I successfully run `busser plugin install busser-bats --force-postinstall`
    Given a suite directory named "bats"

#   Scenario: A passing test suite
    # Given a file in suite "bats" named "default.bats" with:
    # """
    # @test "runs something" {
    #   run echo "hello"
    #   [ "$status" -eq 0 ]
    #   [ "$output" == "hello" ]
    # }

    # """
    # When I run `busser test bats`
    # Then the output should contain:
    # """
    # 1..1
    # ok 1 runs something
    # """
    # And the exit status should be 0

#   Scenario: A failing test suite
#     Given a file in suite "bats" named "default.bats" with:
#     """
#     @test "fails something" {
#       run which uhoh-whatzit-called
#       [ "$status" -eq 0 ]
#     }

#     """
#     When I run `busser test bats`
#     Then the output should contain:
#     """
#     1..1
#     not ok 1 fails something
#     """
#     And the exit status should not be 0
